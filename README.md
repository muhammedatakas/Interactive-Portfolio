# Muhammed Ata Kas - Interactive 3D Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my interactive 3D portfolio, built using Three.js and WebGL. It presents my skills and projects in an immersive format.

## About This Project

This portfolio utilizes a "Multiverse of Code" concept. The main view ("Nexus") displays key skill areas (AI/ML, Web Dev, .NET, Game Dev) as interactive 3D nodes. Clicking a node transitions you into a dedicated "Skill Universe" where related projects are showcased with their own 3D models.

The aim is to offer a unique and engaging way to explore my technical background.

## Key Features

*   WebGL powered via Three.js
*   Interactive 3D navigation (Orbit, Zoom)
*   "Multiverse" concept with transitions between skill areas
*   Dynamic loading of project models
*   Clickable nodes and projects revealing details and links
*   Post-processing effects (e.g., Bloom)
*   Procedural starfield background

## Technology Stack

*   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
*   **3D/Graphics:** Three.js (incl. GLTFLoader), WebGL
*   **Animation:** GSAP
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## Running Locally

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/muhammedatakas/Interactive-Portfolio.git && cd Interactive-Portfolio`
2.  **Serve:** Run a local HTTP server from the project directory.
    *   *Python 3:* `python -m http.server`
    *   *Node.js (with http-server installed):* `http-server -c-1`
3.  **View:** Open `http://localhost:8000` (or the server's port) in your browser.

## Deployment

Deployed via **GitHub Pages**. The live version updates automatically on pushes to the `main` branch.
